all cells have their connected combinations
single sized cages will affect:
its row
its column
its box
these are all queranteed and can be extracted from the cell itself

get all of the affected combinations
if it is and all affected cells are also affected by the single value cell:
recalculate the combination based on the single value cell

if the combination size is 2:

the combination needs to be split into two combinations
the original combination needs to be removed from both cells
the other value then the single value cell must be removed from the affected cell
the single value cell must remain in the other cell

add a new combination to the affected cell without the value of the cell


remeber the combination because its combination is still valid for the other cells




double sized combinations will affect:
its (possible) row
its (possible) column
its (possible) box
each of these conditions must be queranteed

if a single value is present in every combination of a cell:



then branch is done imo
then advanced stuff needs to be done :D
