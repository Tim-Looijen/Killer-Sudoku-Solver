taking a small break from algoritmes to implement a way to export combinations and values to the phone

time for the algoritmes themselves.



we must first do the basic ones, such as the cage fills entire row, column, 3x3 grid but 1 or multiple cells.
and then another basic one such as the cage combinations based on amount of cells and the sum of the cage.
and then one which combines the 2, so that the cage combinations are based on the cells which have quaranteed possible numbers in them.
